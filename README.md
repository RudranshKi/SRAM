# 6T SRAM based on 180 nm technology

SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) is a type of RAM which stores data indefinitely as long as there is power unlike DRAM which loses data gradually even if they are powered. They store 1 bit of data and is faster than DRAM and hence used as cache meomry in processors.
